# Final Report

## Objective

There are a lot of pub/sub protocols for v2v, such as `mqtt`, `zenoh`, and `kafka`. They all perform great in a closed network. But in real world scenerio, there are usually a lot of noises, like Wi-Fi, celluar network, and bluetooth. These noises could lead to packet loss and message delay, which would hurt the performance of these protocols.
We want to simulate a environment that is close to the real world scenerio, and see how different protocols deal with these.
